NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

a meaningful comparison is impossible due to the large difference in the men values. if that was the point then a time series would be unnecessary. if the structure should have been compared then a time series should have been modified by multiplying by an appropriate constant and indicating that in the legend 

small axes labels

the axis labels should be words, not variable names: startdate -> "start date (startdate)"
